		There are some problems with the current way I draw the grapth view...
		Biggest problem is the way I proritize where to draw a node. There
		can be a conflict and multiple nodes are drawn on top of each otehr.


		So you have the hirachy level, this gives you a hint of the location on the screen. 
		All nodes with the same hirachy level with start from the same height.

		However, maybe you have node A and B at level 1 and B links to c. You have to know
		how many links a parrent node have to child node to evenly space the children nodes. Also
		to keep the C node under B and not having it beeing put under A. 

			-	I know there are many algortims for drawing tress
				-	however a lot don't have the challanges with multiple leafs having same child.
					-	I will do some more research before I implement anything.
