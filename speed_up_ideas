hopper uses 10 seconds (9739ms) to load the big binary I am working on, need to load FAST!


Speed up
	[Frontend]
	-	web worker to analyze instruction highlighting
	-	Load as you scroll?
		-	Not sure about this one, it will speed up the loading
			however, if I want to do something I migth be stuck at loading
			either way.
			-	migth hurt under a CTF

	[Backend]
	-	comrpess the json, use lookup values for instruction
		instead of instering all of them
			-	I compressed data with 34.392134472587784%

	-	Have the backend find each block, then the frontend
		can use this data to easier to sepearte blocks
			-	less work for javascript 
			-	minimize reflow anywhere I can....
			
	-	(write some benchmark code like I did for javascript)




QA:
	why not just switch from web to qt? 
		I can write code in the web way faster than I can with QT. Also
		it will look nicer. There are some bottlenecks with writing code
		for the web that I just have to be cleaver about. However I'm sure QT can hold 
		way more objects in frame than a browser can, but program speed is not the reason
		why I choose to write the GUI in web. I want a seperate backend and frontend and having
		the web as a frontend makes the seperation easily. 

	Remove json
		I kinda want to keep json mainly for readability reasons, makes reading 
		the code a lot easier. However the fact that it generated ~17MB of data is 
		way to much. Trafering that over the socket usally makes my session end,
		the times the session does not end it takes way to much time for the socket
		to recive the data. Not good. (this is when I run the backend not on localhost)
