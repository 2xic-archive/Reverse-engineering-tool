need a database for all the registers and access patterns, writing a c moudle seems fun.

What do we want to store?
	-	Register values
		-	at different points in time/at different runs
			-	you should be able to see the difference between all the registers at diffrent runs
			- 	A dynamic array can point to each run, and each run can be stored as a hashtable.
				(want that o(1) lookup when checking for a specific addresses)

			-	this is basically what the current db has to offer.

	-	Memory layout ? 
		-	Maybe you want to see the difference between the memory layout between two runs
			-	This migth add a lot of overhead, need to be cleaver! (dumping 4 gb of memory seems a bit much, especially since a lot will be unallocated)
				-	Unicorn can report changes !
